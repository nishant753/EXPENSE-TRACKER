EXPENSE TRACKER  (Project ID: 12923)  

Project Description: 

The Expense Tracker is a comprehensive web-based application designed to assist individuals in effectively recording, monitoring, and analyzing their daily financial transactions in a structured and efficient manner.  

In today’s fast-paced world, managing personal finances manually using notebooks or spreadsheets often results in several challenges such as:  

- Calculation errors

The application provides a **structured and centralized approach** to financial tracking, ensuring that all data is stored securely and is easily accessible whenever needed.
